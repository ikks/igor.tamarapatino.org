<p>This document describes the installation of Linux on  a SmartStep, also describes the hardware and the factory hardware  problems of this machine. A SmartStep is a laptop sold by Dell. It  is also known as SmartPC in Europe, so installing an SmartStep is the  same as installing the SmartPC. The 200N is similar to 250N, then,  this document applies too to that model.</p>

<a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix">Knoppix</a> helped installing   <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> on this machine. be aware  that this is unstable.  But it has worked fine for me.
</p>
<p>
Use this information at your own risk. I only publish the steps that  worked for me and hope it will be useful for you.
</p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>
We describe the machine specification and some issues that must be 
addresed before attempting an installation. We include some 
configuration files that could be useful for some other laptops,
since some sections are not specific to Dell, but are specific to models
of components that might be used by other manufacturers.

<h2>Brand and Hardware </h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.dell.com">Dell</a> is know positively for it's customer
support. in spite of this, I feel that it wasn't as good as I
expected. You can read the whole story in the <em>Complains</em> section.
</p>
<p>
Dell has a
<a href="http://forum.us.dell.com/supportforums/board?board.id=SS-portGH">forum</a> where people discuss diverse topics. 
</p>
<p>
There is also a <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/linux-dell-laptops/">yahoogroup</a> 
that does not belong to Dell and people speaks open.
</p>
<p>
When I bought this computer the only options available for operating
system were Windows XP Home Edition or Professional, also
2000. Unfortunately there was no option to have an open O.S.
</p>
<p>
The Specifications given here were taken from Appendix of the owner's 
manual.
</p>

<h3>Processor and Memory </h3>

<p>
This is a 2.4 gigahertz Pentium IV with a 400 Mhz bus, a first level
cache of 8 kb, the second level of 512 kb.  An Intel 845 chip set with
data bus of 64 bit, DRAM bus of 64 bits, and address bus of 32 bits.
</p>
<p>
The DDR memory is 512 MegaBytes expandible to 1024 in two slots.
</p>

<h3>Ports </h3>

<p>
The communication between the computer and external devices or networks
can be accomplished with the following: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>PCMCIA TI PCI 1520 supporting 1 Type III card or 2 type II cards at   a maximum data width of 16 bits on PCMCIA and 32 bits for the CardBus.</p></li>
<li><p>Serial : 9 pin connector, 1655C-compatible, 16 byte buffer connector</p></li>
<li><p>Parallel : 25 hole connector, unidirectional, bidirectional or ECP</p></li>
<li><p>Video : 15 hole connector. For a Monitor.</p></li>
<li><p>Microphone : Connector.</p></li>
<li><p>Headphone/speaker : Stereo connector.</p></li>
<li><p>PS/2 Keyboard/mouse : 6 pin mini-DIN connector</p></li>
<li><p>USB : 2 4 pin USB-compliant conector UHCI.</p></li>
<li><p>S-Video TV-Out : 7 pin mini-DIN connector</p></li>
<li><p>Modem : RJ 11. v.92 56K MDC softmodem AC 97 bus</p></li>
<li><p>Network Adapter : RJ 45. RealTek Compatible</p></li>
<li><p>IEEE 1394 : 4 pin serial connector</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Video </h3>

<p>
It worths an apart section to be described, it has a 128 bit hardware
accelerated a Data bus of 4X AGP performing ATI Rage Mobility M6 with
32 MB DDR.  The LCD interface is LVDS and the TV supports NTSC and PAL
in S-video and composite modes.
</p>
<p>
The LCD display is powerful enough to take advantage of the video card,
an active TFT matrix SXGA+ of 15 inches with a maximum resolution of
1400x1050 32bpp (16777216 colors)
</p>
<p>
Has two speakers, and a volume thumb wheel to control them.
</p>

<h3>Keyboard and Mouse </h3>

<p>
It has an 84-key US keyboard and 5 fast keys. Has a touch pad and
wheel in four directions called the scroll pad.
</p>
<p>
The brightness of the screen can be controlled using the keyboard the bright.
Also muting, changing contrast, and the output to TV or alternate video.
</p>

<h3>Storage </h3>

<p>
Not many laptops come with an internal floppy disk drive and a
(CD/DVD/CD-RW) combo.  The SmartStep does.  And also a 40 GB hard
disk.
</p>
<p>
The diskette drive is reported as 
</p>
<pre>
 FDC 0 is a National Semiconductor PC87306
</pre>
<p>
The Combo CD/DVD/CD-RW is reported as
</p>
<pre>
 Vendor: MATSHITA  Model: CDRW/DVD UJDA740  Rev: 1.00
 Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
</pre>
<p>
The Hard disk is reported as 
</p>
<pre>
 IC25N040ATCS04-0, ATA DISK drive
 78140160 sectors (40008 MB) w/1768KiB Cache, CHS=4864/255/63
</pre>

<h3>Wireless </h3>

<p>
When the laptop was bought there was an offer of a wireless card (Dell
TrueMobile 1100) and an access point (Dell TrueMobile 1184 Wireless
Broadband Router), the decission was buying them.  They both work.
</p>


<h2>Partitioning </h2>

<p>
The first thing to be done is partitioning the disk, so the space is
distributed fairly for your own use. I decided to waste
8 Gb on XP Home Edition the rest was for <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, 
in order to use knoppix I made some partitions
</p>
<pre>
 Disk geometry for /dev/hda: 0.000-38154,375 megabytes
 Disk label type: msdos
 Minor    Start       End     Type      Filesystem  Flags
 1          0,031   8001,123  primary   ntfs        boot
 2       8001,123  12770,419  primary   ext3        
 3      12770,420  38154,375  extended              
 5      12770,451  14676,569  logical   ext3        
 6      14676,601  19445,866  logical   ext3        
 8      19445,897  37668,032  logical   ext3        
 7      37668,063  38154,375  logical   linux-swap  
</pre>
<p>
As I already said, the first one is the wasting space :) , the second
is about 5 Gb to hold the whole <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix">knoppix</a> initial installation. The seventh (the last one) is for
swapping, and its size is about the size of the available RAM.
</p>
<p>
The other partitions were left to hold data.  This is a plenty of
space for someone like me, who doesn't buy too much music or who does
not like to get tons of useless software, videos or pictures (no
offense intended).
</p>
<p>
XP came with an NT filesystem, I suggest to use Partition Magic, take
a look at <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and see if you can find a
downloadable legal version.  If not, it will be necessary to boot on
the rescue CD of windows, make the partition with fdisk, or maybe use
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/parted.html">parted</a> if you prefer
a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> tool.
</p>
<p>
In the two later cases you will have to reinstall windows. This
is because Microsft does not provide software to make partitions
without loss of data.  Quite a coincidence.
</p>

<h2>Installing Knoppix </h2>

<p>
Go to <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix">knoppix</a> and get an ISO Image,
or buy a CD. A friend of yours can also give you a copy, that you will
be able to share, since <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix">knoppix</a> is
distributed under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL">GNU/GPL</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are <a href="http://www.freenet.org.nz/misc/knoppix-install.html">howtos</a>
about installing knoppix, I tried versions 3.1 and 3.2 and both were
functional with the SS250N.
</p>
<p>
You can follow the (really easy) instructions and have a knoppix
system working, really fast.
</p>
<p>
Knoppix auto detects the video card, the soundcard, the network
interface, the wireless card if you have plugged it, the floppy,
partitions, so you can browse your windows NTFS tree, the CDROM,
almost everything, the only thing to be done is tune the system.
</p>
<p>
This is the output of the <em>lspci</em> command

</pre>
<p>
I guess it's not necessary to show wath <em>dmesg</em> gives.
</p>
<p>
The next step is making USB work, also IEEE1394, the modem and the
S-Video output.
</p>

<h2>Configuring </h2>

<p>
There are not so many things to worry about when finetuning the
system, just a few ones. Due to the excellent job Knoppix does
autodetecting hardware, which in turn is based on a strong system as
<a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>.
</p>

<h3>Video </h3>

<p>
There is a thing that annoys a lot of people when installing knoppix:
a freeze of the computer when using some login manager like gdm or
kdm.  Maybe it can be solved removing the DRI support, to see which
errors are generating during the launch of X, the following command
can be issued
</p>
<pre>
 grep EE /var/log/XFree86.0.log
</pre>
<p>
which gives the lines where XFree4 is failing. In the case of the
SSN250, the DRI support is responsible for the freeze described
previously.
</p>
<p>
It suffices to comment the lines on <em>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</em> that are
related to DRI.
</p>
<p>
For example
</p>
<pre>
 .
 .
         Load  "dbe"
 #       Load  "dri"
         Load  "extmod"
 .
 .
</pre>
<p>
and 
</p>
<pre>
 .
 .
 #Section "DRI"
 #       Mode 0666
 #EndSection
 .
 .
</pre>
<p>
The other thing to do is make use of the whole screen, this is
1400x1050(24 bpp). Here is a working <a href="files/XF86Config-4">files/XF86Config-4</a> config file, use
it at your own risk. This is a warning, see if you survive after
trying.
</p>

<h3>LILO </h3>

<p>
There were a few changes left, use the speed of the bus, and telling
the only scsi was the installed on hdc where the CD is attached on the
laptop, so it's able to burn.
</p>
<p>
Example of the line on lilo.conf
</p>
<pre>
 append="hdc=scsi idebus=400 apm=power-off nomce"
</pre>
<p>
There is the <a href="files/lilo.conf">files/lilo.conf</a>, if you use it, don't forget to run lilo,
and make sure the partition scheme is correct with yours.  '''Be 
careful about using this one, since your special configuration of
partitions can vary a lot'''.
</p>

<h3>USB </h3>

<p>
Make sure the <em>usb</em> and <em>usb-uhci</em> modules are loaded into the
kernel, if not there is <em>insmod</em> to help you.
</p>
<p>
Please read the FileSystems section, before trying the next
application.
</p>
<p>
An application that makes easy to check if the USB ports are correctly
configured is <a href="http://www.sf.net">usbview</a>, beacuse it allows to see if
there are new hardware attached to an USB port.
</p>
<p>
If you want to know more about USB ports under linux, the 
<a href="http://www.linux-usb.org">the linux usb project</a> is your friend.
</p>
<p>
I plugged a <a href="http://www.jvc.com/product.jsp?modelId=MODL026465&amp;page=2">JVC DVL 815</a> via USB port. It was reported as '''mass storage
device''', so one can mount it as a device on a tree directory,
where it's possible to browse and write in the memory card.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/camera.jpg" alt="images/camera.jpg">
</p>
<p>
In the <a href="files/fstab">files/fstab</a>, the line according to the mounting info is at
/media/dsc
</p>

<h3>FileSystems </h3>

<p>
If you want the USB filesystem to be mounted at boot, put the line
</p>
<pre>
 none            /proc/bus/usb             usbdevfs        defaults   0   0
</pre>
<p>
on the fstab file, here is my <a href="files/fstab">files/fstab</a>, if you look at this file,
you'll find the lines that helped me to mount the ISO images of Debian
3.0R1 that I have on my computer, to help install a little faster
through the package system.
</p>
<p>
As a bonus, here is my <a href="files/sources.list">files/sources.list</a>.  As usual, use it at your own
risk.
</p>

<h3>Modem </h3>

<p>
I have not tried the modem, maybe using the
<a href="http://www.linuxant.com/drivers/">hcfpc</a> drivers.  Maybe some others?
</p>

<h3>IEEE1394 </h3>

<p>
The work done at <a href="http://www.linux1394.org">linux1394</a> is the one that
makes it possible to use the firewire port.  A few things needs to be
done to get it working.
</p>
<p>
The modules <em>ieee1394</em>, <em>video1394</em>, <em>raw1394</em>, <em>ohci1394</em> can
be loaded via <em>modconf</em>.
</p>
<p>
Follows the creation of special files (nodes):
</p>
<pre>
 mkdir /dev/video1394
 mknod -m 666 /dev/video1394/0 c 171 16
 mknod -m 666 /dev/video1394/1 c 171 17
 mknod -m 666 /dev/video1394/2 c 171 18
 mknod -m 666 /dev/video1394/3 c 171 19
</pre>
<p>
To test if it's working, just use <a href="http://gscanbus.berlios.de/">gscanbus</a>,
</p>
<pre>
 it shows graphically the ieee1394 port status.
</pre>

<h3>ACPI </h3>

<p>
This one replaces APM, and has a lot of useful features. The BIOS is
ACPI compliant, so if this is included in the kernel, many things can
be done with that, like hibernate and low energy consume.
</p>
<p>
This section is all due to <a href="mailto:roychris@NOSPAM_free.fr">Christophe Roy</a>, 
( Thanks ) do not blame him, neither me ;) if this doesn't work, review 
carefully the readings and apply them, I haven't done so....
</p>
<p>
The ACPI support for linux on this laptop requires a
<a href="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/view.php?id=41">DSDT</a>.
</p>
<p>
Literally from him :
</p>
<p>
Acpi is now working for suspending disk and ram.
You must have at least <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.9.tar.bz2">kernel (2.6.9)</a> (Dec/2004)
with the <a href="http://swsusp.sf.net">swsusp2 patch</a>.
For disk suspending, use the hibernate application (It works perfectly).
For RAM suspending, it's a little bit more complicated :
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use module for USB, PCMCIA.</p></li>
<li><p>Use XFree 4.0 or 3.99.</p></li>
<li><p>Use this <a href="http://www.doesi.gmxhome.de/linux/tm800s3/resources/boot-radeon">binary driver for the ATI Radeon</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Read other <a href="http://www.doesi.gmxhome.de/linux/tm800s3/s3.html">explanations</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>unload all modules</p></li>
<li><p>type <code>echo -n 3 &gt; /proc/acpi/sleep</code> as root</p></li>
<li><p>to resume, press the power button.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
The probability of clean resuming is 5/6 on my computer.
</p>

<h3>Localization </h3>

<p>
I live at Bogotá, so I need accents to work, as mentioned earlier this
is a US keyboard, the need for the deadkeys was satisfied adding
</p>
<pre>
 keycode 115 =  Multi_key
</pre>
<p>
The spanish environment was added modifying <a href="files/locale.alias">files/locale.alias</a>,
<a href="files/locale.gen">files/locale.gen</a> and <a href="files/profile">files/profile</a>.  It's mandatory to run
<em>locale-gen</em>.
</p>

<h3>List of modules </h3>

<p>
When issuing the command <em>lsmod</em> finally there appears with the
IEEE1394, the USB, the wireless card attached the following :
</p>

<h2>Useful software </h2>

<p>
When trying to use DVDs at Bogotá, Windows was useless, so I prefered
to try [mplayer <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">http://www.mplayerhq.hu</a>], which works excellent.
There is another one called <a href="http://www.dtek.chalmers.se/groups/dvd/">ogle</a> if you can not live without the menus to drive the playback.

<p>
When an user wants to play DVDs, it's mandatory to be in the groups

<h2>TODO </h2>

<ul>
<li><p>S-Video to be written, I have to get an S-Video cable to see if it  works, I need also a TV or other thing that supports it.  For the  moment if you want to try if it works consider  <a href="http://www.stud.uni-hamburg.de/users/lennart/projects/atitvout/">AtiTVOut</a> or <a href="http://gatos.sf.net">Gatos Project</a></p></li>

<h2>Complaining </h2>

<p>
This section has two purposes, let you complain about the document,
and let me complain about DELL.
</p>

<h3>on the document </h3>

<p>
As you can see, we didn't have to compile the kernel nor I mention the
need to, on this document.  The default kernel shipped with Knoppix
made everything, and there comes a lot of other advanced options if
you want to try.
</p>
<p>
Don't ask me about compiling or which options are necessary in order
to make something work.  My email filter only allows emails that
contain improvements to this document or useful links :)
</p>

<h3>About DELL </h3>

<p>
I live at Bogotá Colombia, and a good friend of me brought me the
SmartStep to my home from USA.  The model was only available there at
the moment of the purchase.
</p>
<p>
From the beginning the computer came autoshutting down, the reason is
the following :
</p>
<p>
''The issue is that it has a desktop processor, so it gets hotter, I
wasn't able to use my computer for about 4 months, there is a long
process when you want to get support from Dell, at least, when the
laptop comes from USA to Colombia.''
</p>
<p>
Dell has changed the board twice, and finally changed the fan cooler,
it's noisy now, but it's finally working, I didn't have the problems
about 'auto shutdown', 'crashing', 'turning of', 'overheating' that
are the complains about this laptop until june of 2004, when they
came again.
</p>
<p>
In 2005-august I received an email about overheating caused by dust.
</p>
<p>
The text between the lines is what <a href="mailto:robert.wolterman@gmail.com">Robert Wolterman</a>
kindly sent me :

<p>
I know how to fix the overheating problem. I don't know if you've
gotten emails about it before, but if you clean out the heatsink and
remove the dust blocking the internal baffles, it runs a lot better,
until it clogs again.
</p>
<p>
This is a <a href="http://www2.ntconseil.com/smartstep/">link to a site</a> 
that demonstrates a cleaning process.
</p>
<p>
I modified that process by unscrewing the keyboard, and actually
disassembling the heatsink to get the clog out better. My method
requires thermal compound for the processor when you put the heat sink
back on.
</p>
<p>
I have to clean my heatsink every 3/5 months depending on where I've
used my computer.
</p>
<p>
I've had good success with it so far, but I'm always wary when I do it
as to not destroy the processor.
</p>
<p>
I can't be held responsible if the 
computer gets messed up. The cleaning is also unsupported by Dell, so
if something goes wrong while cleaning, they probably won't fix it for
you.
